Description: From 2000- 2018 debt to GDP in over 30 countries has varied greatly. The chart above shows each country's Debt-to-GDP ratio and data. 

## Debt-to-GDP Ratio by Country

Description: The debt-to-GDP ratio in various countries has been vast and fast growing for some. Using this chart, we are able to see how th GDP to debt ratio has changed year over year bu country.

Description: The line chart below shows how the debt-to-GDP ratio has changed annually by country and also comparatively to each other.

## The different methods of visualization 
Using the same data with multiple methods of visualization, I was able to see how different visualizations can convey the same data in many ways to show the same data in different ways. Within the first chart, having the debt-to-GDP ratio broken out by country allowed for a comparative picture, but also can be overwhelming to the viewer. The use of the blue/purple color against the grey allowed for a stark comparison. However, I do think this chart and the color I picked does not completely align with the message, I tried to use red instead but then it looked too intrusive. Upon second glance, I decided to show this data in a different light and break it out by country in the same chart, to allow for the viewer to not be lost moving from one chart to another that are seperate. Additionally, I used the color red here to signify loss, as it is a GDP-to-debt ratio. Sadly, when embedding chart into GitHub it cut off part of the chart (I am not sure why, I tried to play around with it a little). I put the countries at the top for easy toggling between the countries, this allows not only allows the viewer to compare GPD-to-debt ratio comparisons by country, but also within country by years. 

For the third data visualization, I used a line chart that moves as you scroll throughout the years, as to allow the view to see the GDP-to-debt ratio more clearly. I again used the red color to make a clear dichotomy, however I also played around with the font this time and made the title and filters dark black while the x and y axis and labels I kept more grey. I decided to keep the labels grey instead of black after this week's reading "Make Grey your Best Friend". I think this version of the data presentation allowed to view all of the countries together, which I will admit is a bit chaotic, but I think when you break it out into the respective countries, you are better able to see the trends. I also added a trend line to the country to show trend within each country. Once again, I kept this grey as to not ditract from the importance of the red-line which is the main point of the chart.
